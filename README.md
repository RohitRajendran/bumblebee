# Bumblebee üêù

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/RohitRajendran/bumblebee/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

Have one of those directories in your building that calls your phone to buzz people in? Tired of having to answer the phone and pressing 9 everytime you need to let someone in? Now Bumblebee can take care of that for you! Using Twilio and Azure Functions (through the Serverless Framework), you can text the Twilio number to set time periods that Bumblebee should automatically buzz people in. Any calls when Bumblebee is not active will automatically forward to your phone.

## Getting Started üé¨

1. Create a Twilio account and get a local number. You can sign up with this [link](www.twilio.com/referral/eLK56S) and we'll both get \$10 in Twilio Credit.
1. If you don't have an Azure account, you'll need to set that up as well as setup Azure CLI. You can follow the steps for authenticating with an Azure Service Principal that's listed in the [Serverless docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/azure/guide/credentials#1-download-the-azure-cli-or-use-the-azure-cloud-shell)
1. Create a Firebase project and set up a Firebase Realtime Database

## Running Locally üíª

1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
1. Convert `local.sample.json` to `local.json` and fill in the env variables
1. Run `npm start`

## Env Variables üîë

Pass these in as env variables during build or convert `local.sample.json` to `local.json` for running locally
